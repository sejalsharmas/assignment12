        It was built in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh for the court harem so that they could witness the royal processions and the street life. The exquisite pink and red sandstone ‘mahal’ stands out for its striking architecture, and the beautiful ‘jhaali’ works on its 953 windows.

        Known as Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh’s favourite resort, the palace was designed by an architect named Lal Chand Usta. The Hawa Mahal architecture is defined by its five-story tiered shape that rises to about 50 feet. The elevated facade resembles a honeycomb with small portholes, each with miniature windows, carved sandstone grills, and finials. The interior however consists of minimalistic decorative elements as compared to its gaudy exteriors.

The walls around the hall hold carved marble relief panels. The hall provides enchanting vistas of the Maota Lake.

        On top of Jai Mandir is Jas Mandir, a hall of private audience with floral glass inlays and alabaster relief work.
        
        The other building seen in the courtyard is opposite to the Jai Mandir and is known as the Sukh Niwas or Sukh Mahal (Hall of Pleasure). This hall is approached through a sandalwood door. The walls are decorated with marble inlay work with niches called "chînî khâna". A piped water supply flows through an open channel that runs through this edifice keeping the environs cool, as in an air-conditioned environment. The water from this channel flows into the garden.
