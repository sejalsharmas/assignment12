        It was built in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh for the court harem so that they could witness the royal processions and the street life. The exquisite pink and red sandstone ‘mahal’ stands out for its striking architecture, and the beautiful ‘jhaali’ works on its 953 windows.

        Known as Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh’s favourite resort, the palace was designed by an architect named Lal Chand Usta. The Hawa Mahal architecture is defined by its five-story tiered shape that rises to about 50 feet. The elevated facade resembles a honeycomb with small portholes, each with miniature windows, carved sandstone grills, and finials. The interior however consists of minimalistic decorative elements as compared to its gaudy exteriors.
